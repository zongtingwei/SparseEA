## üìñ Introduction

SparseEA is a MATLAB-based evolutionary algorithm designed for solving multi-objective feature selection problems in classification tasks. It leverages advanced evolutionary strategies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the feature selection process.

This implementation is based on the code of [SM-MOEA](https://github.com/BIMK/SM-MOEA) and [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). Please refer to the original paper [An Evolutionary Algorithm for Large-Scale Sparse Multiobjective Optimization Problems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8720021) for detailed information about the algorithm's overview, methodology, and benchmark results.

This code was developed for feature selection tasks in classification. The framework can be adapted to other feature selection scenarios with minor modifications.
